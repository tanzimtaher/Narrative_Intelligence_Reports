# Strategic Diagnosis

1. **Bobby’s strengths**
    - Higher **sentiment** and **engagement per post**.
    - Strong **student/youth + BNP-sympathetic base**.
    - A digital UGC team capable of seeding micro-waves and generating mid-sized spikes.
    - Content that, when it lands, can **outperform Mobarak in impact score**.

2. **Bobby’s weaknesses**
    - **Low posting volume** and **very low non-seeded share of voice**.
    - Digital network is **fragmented** – too many pages with little or no impact.
    - Issue mix is **over-focused on candidate & partisan identity**, under-focused on:
        - jobs & economic security
        - women’s empowerment / safety
        - health & education
        - broader “fairness / justice / integrity” framed for swing voters (not only BNP frame).

3. **Mobarak’s advantages**
    - **Dominates visibility** – more posts, higher SOV, big influence spikes.
    - Centralised, efficient Facebook presence.
    - Ties campaign to **specific tangible themes**: jobs, certificates, women’s empowerment, rallies, health programs, Jamaat identity.
    - These themes resonate with **uncertain / swing voters** who aren’t hardcore partisans.

4. **Mobarak’s vulnerabilities**
    - Lower **engagement per post** and **lower sentiment**.
    - Heavy association with **Jamaat-e-Islami** – good for core base, but may **scare or alienate moderate, secular, or undecided voters**, especially urban women and some middle-class families.
    - Very **top-down content**: mostly from a single page; less evidence of broad community-led conversation.

5. **Strategic ground truth**
    - The battle is **not** about convincing the hard core.
    - The **62% swing** will go with:
        1. The candidate they **see more often**,
        2. Who can link **concrete life improvements** (jobs, safety, services) to **credible behavior**,
        3. Without triggering too much **fear or fatigue**.
        
        Right now, **Mobarak owns (1)** and **parts of (2)**.
        
        Bobby has a better position on **(3)** and **post-level quality**, but **not enough volume** and **not enough policy-coded messaging**.
