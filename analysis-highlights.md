# Analysis Highlights

## Volume, sentiment, and efficiency (non-seeded only)

- Mobarak is posting ~**5× more** non-seeded content.
- In *organic* conversations, Mobarak dominates the public timeline. Bobby is under-visible.
- Even after weighting by engagement, Mobarak still has more influence overall – but the gap is smaller than the raw volume gap.
- Bobby’s **average post is ~3.4× more engaging** than Mobarak’s.
- Engagement per post, Bobby’s content **hits harder**.
- Bobby attracts **warmer sentiment** in organic chatter.

### **Takeaway:**

Mobarak owns **visibility and narrative volume**. Bobby owns **quality and sentiment** per post. Swing voters are more *likely* to like Bobby when they see him – but they’re seeing Mobarak much more often.

## Seeding / promotions

- Overall / non-seeded dashboard showed a **large majority of conversations tagged “yes (included)”** in the seeding pie – so the ecosystem itself is already very promotion-heavy.
- **Bobby (blended):** almost all conversations are in the “yes” category – his digital UGC machine is working; lots of fan pages and search-based tracking around him.
- **Mobarak (blended):** still very seeding-heavy, but his “no” segment is a bit larger than Bobby’s – he benefits more from **organic spillover** of his campaign content.

### **Implication:**

Both sides are pushing content, but **Mobarak’s seeding translates into more broad-base organic chatter**, while Bobby’s seeding is more **concentrated in his own fandom bubble**.

## Narrative evolution (micro-waves and spikes)

### Bobby Hajjaj – blended narrative evolution

Looking at the time-sorted “Narrative Evolution – Influence Score” tables for Bobby:

- We see **repeated mid-size waves**:
- These waves often have a **lead-up of smaller “micro-waves”** (scores in the 5–50 range) a few hours before the big spike.
- Interpreting this:
    - Bobby’s team is already **seeding micro-conversations** (fan pages, smaller posts) which build a floor of engagement.
    - Then **one or two large posts** (rally, photo dump, video, or a central page post) push the spike.
    - His spikes are **mid-to-high**, but **not gigantic** compared to Mobarak’s.

### Mobarak Hossain – blended narrative evolution

- Mobarak’s tables show **much larger spike magnitudes.** Similar micro-wave structure (small influence events leading into big ones), but his **major spikes are an order of magnitude larger**.
- This suggests **large “anchor” posts or events** (probably live rallies, job-card events, women’s empowerment programs, or Jamaat-linked mobilisations) that get **heavy interaction from core supporters + religious networks** and then echo across timelines.

### **Comparative insight:**

- Bobby’s **tempo is okay**, but his ceilings are **lower**.
- Mobarak’s spikes are **less frequent but much more explosive**, giving him **dominant visibility after each big event**.
- Swing voters who log in only a few times a week are **more likely to catch Mobarak’s spikes than Bobby’s**.

## Conversation Channels

### Bobby Channels

From the “Channels/Phrases Used To Track Conversations” table:

- Multiple **fan pages**: “Fans of Bobby Hajjaj”, “WE ARE FAN BOBBY HAJJAJ”, “Bobby Hajjaj FAN PAGES”, “Believe in Bobby Hajjaj”, etc.
- A smaller number of posts from his **main page/profile**.
- **Pattern:**
    - He has a **distributed fan-page ecosystem**, but **influence is extremely concentrated in a single search-captured domain** (“bobby hajjaj ndm”) and a couple of pages.
    - Several fan pages show **0% share of influence** or very low numbers → **dead weight pages**.

### Mobarak Channels

- Mobarak’s digital presence is **highly centralised** around his **main page**.
- His search-based visibility is heavily tied to **“Jamaat”** – his ideological identity.
- **Implication:**
    - Bobby: **broad but inefficient network** – lots of pages, but only a few are pulling real engagement.
    - Mobarak: **tight and efficient** – one primary hub that amplifies every major move.

## Issue ownership (what each candidate "stands for" online)

### The **constituency’s real mind-space** is:

1. **Campaign & fairness of elections**
2. **Health & education**
3. **Jobs, youth and women’s roles / safety**
4. **Macro politics (BNP vs others, repression)**

### **Bobby:**

- The Bobby list is **very candidate-centric** and **politics-centric**:
    - Lots of focus on **him**, **BNP leadership**, **student politics**, **campaign optics**.
- Much less weight (in the top slots) on **jobs, women’s empowerment, health, education**, even though these are strong issues overall.

### **Mobarak:**

- Mobarak is **anchored in bread-and-butter + identity issues**:
    - **Women’s empowerment**
    - **Jobs and job certificates**
    - **Jamaat identity + rallies**
    - **Social equality, development, political reform**
- He **directly touches more of the high-salience policy themes** (jobs, women, health, equality) than Bobby does.

### **Summary of issue gaps:**

- Bobby dominates **“BNP-aligned youth + community engagement + candidate image”**.
- Mobarak owns **“jobs + women’s empowerment + Jamaat mobilisation + fairness & development”**.
- The **overall electorate cares about BOTH sets**, but **swing voters will be sensitive to jobs, fairness, safety, and services** → right now those **map more clearly to Mobarak’s narrative**.
