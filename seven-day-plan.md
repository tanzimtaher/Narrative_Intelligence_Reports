# 7-Day Plan for Bobby Hajjaj's Campaign Team

### Overall objectives for the next 7 days

1. **Close the visibility gap** without diluting quality:
    - Target: **at least 2–3× current posting volume** on non-seeded channels.
2. **Re-balance the issue mix**:
    - Add **jobs, women, health, education, fairness & safety** to every day’s content plan.
3. **Exploit Mobarak’s vulnerabilities** gently:
    - Contrast **inclusive development & rule of law** vs **ideological polarisation**.
4. **Synchronise digital + on-ground micro-events**:
    - Every large digital spike should map to **a real activity/activation** swing voters can touch.

---

### Content pillars for the week 

Use 4 main pillars and cycle them:

1. **Jobs & Youth Futures**
    - Apprenticeships, skill training, SMEs, tech jobs.
2. **Women’s Safety & Empowerment**
    - Work, transport, education, healthcare, representation.
3. **Health & Education Services**
    - Diabetes, clinics, school quality, mental health.
4. **Fair & Dignified Politics**
    - Election integrity, protection from violence, legal rights, community voice.

Each digital asset should sit under one pillar and **explicitly connect Dhaka-13 voters’ everyday problems** to Bobby’s plan or behavior.

---

### Fixing the digital machinery

**(A) Rationalize pages within 24 hours**

- Identify **top-performing 3–4 pages/search nodes** (e.g., “bobby hajjaj ndm” + most engaging fan page + official page).
- For the rest:
    - Either **go dormant** or convert to **content-mirror channels** that just share the main posts.
- Ensure **every major piece** is:
    1. Posted on the **official page**,
    2. Immediately **shared by 3–5 key fan pages**,
    3. Then **boosted selectively** where needed.

**Why:**

You already saw that influence is concentrated; trimming dead pages **raises average engagement** and **simplifies coordination**, letting micro-waves build more cleanly.

---

### Day-by-day plan (7 days)

### **Day 1 – Reset & Positioning**

**Goal:** Reframe Bobby in voters’ minds around **jobs + safety + fairness**, not just BNP identity.

**Digital**

- **Anchor post (video or strong photo story)** from Bobby himself:
    - Theme: “What I owe to Dhaka-13 in the next five years.”
    - Include **three concrete commitments**:
        1. Jobs/skills program for youth,
        2. Safe streets and transport for women,
        3. Cleaner, fairer politics.
- **Fan page micro-waves** (same day, 3–4 posts):
    - Short quotes from the video turned into **graphic tiles**.
    - Volunteers commenting with personal testimonials: “I found work through his initiative in X…”
- Aim for **one big spike** by clustering all shares within a **3–4-hour window** in the evening.

**Below-the-line (BTL)**

- Organise **two small indoor meetings**:
    1. With local youth groups (coaching centres, tuition hubs).
    2. With women leaders (school teachers, NGO workers).
- Capture **short testimonial clips** and photos for use on Days 3–4.

---

### **Day 2 – Women’s Empowerment vs Symbolic Rallies**

**Goal:** Challenge Mobarak’s ownership of “women’s empowerment” in a **more concrete, less ideological way**.

**Digital**

- **Case-study post**: Highlight a real local woman (micro-entrepreneur, teacher, nurse, social worker).
    - Show how policy + support (not just slogans) change her daily life.
- Short explainer carousel:
    
    “3 things women in Mohammadpur told me they need right now” – safety at night, job access, healthcare/childcare.
    
- Ask followers to **tag women they want honoured**; this fuels **organic, non-seeded comments**.

**BTL**

- **Street-level “listening corners” for women** near markets / schools:
    - 2–3 volunteers + 1 female representative from Bobby’s team.
    - Collect grievances and requests; promise specific follow-up.
- The act of showing up and listening becomes **photo/video content for Day 4**.

---

### **Day 3 – Jobs & Youth Futures**

**Goal:** Compete directly with Mobarak’s “employment & job certificate” narrative, but with a broader, more credible framing.

**Digital**

- **Infographic or short video**:
    - “5 ways Dhaka-13 youth can get better jobs in the next 2 years” (apprenticeships, freelance, local SMEs, tech skilling hubs, university links).
- Use snippets from Day-1 youth meeting:
    - 15–30s reels with students asking questions + Bobby replying.
- Encourage **Q&A in comments**; have digital team **answer concretely**, not with slogans.

**BTL**

- **Campus / coaching-centre micro-sessions**:
    - 2–3 per day in areas where youth already gather.
- Hand out a **one-page “Youth Future Plan”** with a QR linking to the video.

---

### **Day 4 – Health & Education**

**Goal:** Occupy issue slots where overall influential issues are strong but neither candidate fully dominates.

**Digital**

- Post from a **clinic or school visit**:
    - Focus on diabetes awareness, school inspection, mental health – all visible in the issue list.
- Make this a **“service-not-politics”** day:
    - Less party logo, more **community service visuals** (doctors, teachers, families).
- Ask people to comment with **local problems in hospitals/schools**; commit to raising specific ones publicly.

**BTL**

- **Mini health camp** (even if symbolic):
    - Free blood pressure / diabetes check-up in partnership with local doctors.
- **School gate outreach**:
    - Volunteers talk to parents during pick-up time, hand out simple leaflets about education priorities.

---

### **Day 5 – Fair & Dignified Politics**

**Goal:** Contrast Bobby’s style with Mobarak’s Jamaat-linked rallies **without direct mud-slinging**.

**Digital**

- Long-form post or video:
    - Theme: “Politics without fear and revenge in Dhaka-13.”
    - Talk about:
        - Respecting different opinions,
        - Protecting minorities and dissenters,
        - Keeping community harmony during and after elections.
- Use **soft comparative language**:
    - “We cannot afford politics that divides neighbours over ideology alone…”
    - Let readers make the Mobarak/Jamaat connection themselves.

**BTL**

- **Neighborhood peace circles**:
    - Small courtyard gatherings where Bobby (or reps) emphasise **zero tolerance for violence** during the campaign.
- Invite **community elders and religious figures** who are uncomfortable with overtly partisan religious mobilization.

---

### **Day 6 – Amplify what’s working (replicate your spikes)**

**Goal:** Look at which of the last 5 days’ posts produced spikes similar to Oct 29 / Nov 11 / Nov 16 and **double down on that style.**

**Digital**

- Identify the **top 2 posts of the week** by:
    - Engagement per post,
    - Share of influence, and
    - Positive sentiment.
- Create **“part 2” content** in the same format:
    - If it was a heartfelt video → another short, honest video.
    - If it was a strong photo story → another from a new neighbourhood.
- Run **a full-network share wave**:
    - Official page → key fan pages → supporters reposting with personal captions.

**BTL**

- Synchronize with **at least one medium-sized physical event**:
    - Youth town-hall, women’s meet-up, health camp report-back, or a community clean-up.
- Use on-ground volunteers to **capture many small clips** → raw material for election-eve micro-content.

---

### **Day 7 – Swing Voter Consolidation**

**Goal:** Turn the week’s narrative into a **coherent choice** for undecided voters.

**Digital**

- **Summary video / carousel**:
    - “This is what we did in Dhaka-13 this week”:
        - Jobs meetings,
        - Women’s listening sessions,
        - Health/education visits,
        - Peace & fairness circles.
- Explicitly address the **swing voter**:
    - “If you’re still undecided, here’s what you can *measure me by*: how I show up in your neighborhood, not just what I say on Facebook.”

**BTL**

- Door-to-door in **mixed neighborhoods** (where Mobarak’s rallies were strong):
    - Volunteers carry **1–2 simple talking points per pillar**, no long speeches.
- Collect **phone numbers / Messenger contacts** for follow-up.
- End with a **quiet but visible presence** at evening community spaces (tea stalls, parks, mosque peripheries), focusing on listening, not lecturing.

---

### Metrics to watch over the week

1. **Non-seeded Share of Voice** for Bobby  
2. **Engagement per Post**  
3. **Share of Influence**  
4. **Issue mix**:
    - In the “Influential Issues” list for Bobby-mentioned conversations, watch:
        - How often “jobs/employment”, “women’s empowerment”, “health/education”, “election integrity” appear in top 20.
5. **Sentiment**
